    <h2>
      THE PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. The word "ballad" is admittedly of very wide significance. Meaning
      originally "a song intended as the accompaniment to a dance," it was
      afterwards applied to "a light simple song of any kind" with a leaning
      towards the sentimental or romantic; and, in its present use, is defined
      by Dr Murray as "a simple spirited poem in short stanzas, in which some
      popular story is graphically told." Passing over the obsolete sense of "a
      popular song specially celebrating or scurrilously attacking some person
      or institution," we may note that Dr Johnson calls a ballad "a song," and
      quotes a statement from Watts that it once "signified a solemn and sacred
      song as well as a trivial, when Solomon's Song was called the 'The Ballad
      of Ballads,' but now it is applied to nothing but trifling verse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ballad-collectors, however, have never strictly regarded any one of these
      definitions, and to me their catholicity seems worthy of imitation. I have
      demanded no more of a ballad than that it should be a simple spirited
      narrative; and, though excluding the pure lyrics and metrical romances
      found in Percy's <i>Reliques</i> or elsewhere, I have been guided in
      doubtful cases rather by intuition than by rule. I have included poems
      written in every variety of metre except blank verse, and even the latter
      may seem to be represented by Blake's <i>Fair Elinor</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, this is a collection of poems, not of archaeological specimens
      or verses on great historic events; and the ballads have been chosen
      according to my judgment of their artistic merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Vols. I. and II. contain the best traditionary ballads of England and
      Scotland, with a small group of Peasant Ballads still sung in country
      districts. Vols. III. and IV. contain selected modern experiments in the
      art of ballad-writing by English, Scotch, and Welsh poets, with a mixed
      group of Irish ballads; those on foreign or classical subjects being in
      each case excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      a. The text of the old ballads has been carefully prepared from the best
      authorities, and the spelling is modernised so far as can be done without
      injuring the rhythm or accentuation. Brief historical or explanatory notes
      are printed in the Table of Contents, and obsolete terms are explained in
      footnotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      No attempt has been made to settle disputed dates of composition, but the
      ballads are arranged in groups according to the collection (e.g. Percy's
      <i>Reliques</i>, Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, etc.) in which they were first
      included, and thus brought before the notice of the literary public. The
      groups are arranged according to the dates of publication of the
      collections.
    </p>
    <p>
      b. For the Peasant Ballads one text is seldom more authoritative than
      another, and minor differences have to be settled by personal judgment.
      The versions here offered, have, in many cases, been prepared from those
      popular in different parts of England. They are believed to represent the
      most poetical form of the songs which were the favourites of the elder
      generation, and which are being now superseded by the shorter and more
      sensational effusions of the music-hall. They are arranged according to
      their subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      c. The modern ballads are arranged chronologically, according to the dates
      of birth of their authors, and are intended to be, so far as possible,
      representative of our best poets. Parodies and dialect poems have been
      purposely omitted, because they form classes by themselves and are
      essentially different in spirit from both the traditionary and the
      literary ballads. This restriction does not involve the omission of all
      poems with humorous subjects or treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      By calling these ballads "modern" I do not wish to imply that every one of
      them was written later than those in Vols. I. and II., since it is
      practically certain that some of the Peasant group belong to this century.
      They are modern in the sense of being literary productions by known
      authors, which were offered to the public in a printed form from the
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      d. Irish ballads, written in English, are comparatively modern, but they
      belong to the traditionary manner and, whether the work of ballad-mongers
      or of poets, need not be separated from the few translations from the
      Irish which have been thought suitable for this collection. They too are
      arranged chronologically.
    </p>
    <p>
      e. A similar group of Welsh ballads was projected, but after a careful
      investigation of the principal periodicals and collections, and some
      correspondence with students of Welsh literature, I have concluded that,
      for English readers at least, there exist but few Welsh ballads of any
      merit; and that the poetic genius of the nation could not be fairly
      represented by such a selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. a. Every student of our old ballads owes an immeasurable debt of
      gratitude to Professor F. J. Child, whose monumental collections * have
      covered the entire field. I have naturally followed his guidance in the
      choice of texts and used his transcripts from manuscripts, having received
      his cordial permission to do so, in letters of kind advice and sympathy.

     Mifflin &amp; Co.); "The English and Scottish Ballads"&mdash;in the

     appeared (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.).
</pre>
    <p>
      My thanks are also due to Dr Furnivall and Professor Hales for answers to
      questions and permission to follow their reprint of <i>The Percy Folio</i>;
      to Professor Skeat for the use of his transcript of <i>The Hunting of the
      Cheviot</i>; to Mr W. C. Hazlitt for a portion of an old copy of <i>Adam
      Bell, Clym of the Clough, and William Cloudeslè</i>; and to the Council of
      the Folk-lore Society for the version of the <i>Unquiet Grave</i> which
      appeared in their <i>Record</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      b. In the preparation of the Peasant group I have received great
      assistance from the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, who has generously put at my
      disposal the results of his life-long studies in this subject, given me
      advice and information at every turn, and allowed me the free use of all
      his own manuscript and printed material. Without his help and
      encouragement this part of the work could never have been completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My thanks are also due to numerous members of the Folk-lore Society, both
      in London and the provinces, among whom I would particularly mention Miss
      C. S. Burne, author of <i>Shropshire Folk-lore</i>, and Mrs Balfour of
      Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have received much assistance also from Miss Lucy E. Broadwood, who has
      united with Mr J. A. Fuller-Maitland and the Leadenhall Press, Ltd., in
      permitting me to reprint from her <i>English County Songs</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For replies to various questions on these subjects I am indebted to Messrs
      A. T. Quiller-Couch, W. E. A. Axon, Edward Peacock, the Rev. J. C.
      Atkinson, Judge Hughes, Miss Field, and Miss G. Chanter. Messrs G. Bell
      &amp; Sons have kindly allowed me to reprint "Sir Arthur and charming
      Mollee" from their <i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry
      of England</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      c. For the use of copyright matter my thanks are further due to Messrs
      Macmillan &amp; Co., the publishers of Charles Kingsley, and Miss
      Rossetti; to Messrs Smith, Elder &amp; Co., of Robert Browning; to Messrs
      Chatto &amp; Windus, of G. W. Thombury; to Messrs Elis &amp; Elvey, of D.
      G. Rossetti; Messrs Ward, Lock &amp; Bowden, of Henry Kingsley; Messrs
      Kegan Paul &amp; Co., of Mrs Hamilton-King; Messrs Messina &amp; Co.,
      Melbourne, of A. L. Gordon; and Mr C. Baxter, the agent of Mr R. L.
      Stevenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also indebted to Sir George Young, Bart., for information concerning
      W. M. Praed; to. Mr Sebastian Evans; Mrs W. B. Scott; Mrs Dobell; Dr
      George MacDonald; Miss Jean Ingelow and her publishers, Messrs Longmans,
      Green &amp; Co.; Mrs Isa Craig Knox; Mrs Calverly; Dr Garnett; Mrs Cory
      and the publisher of the late William Cory, Mr George Allen; Mr A. C.
      Swinburne; Madame Darmsteter; Miss Grant; Mr Ernest Rhys; Mr R. Buchanan;
      Mr John Davidson; Mr Rudyard Kipling and his publishers, Messrs Methuen
      &amp; Co., and Messrs Thacker &amp; Co.; and Miss G. Chanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having found every endeavour vain to discover the address of the Misses
      Hawker, I have ventured to reprint <i>The Doom of St Madron</i>, by the
      late R. S. Hawker, without their permission, the publishers, Messrs Kegan
      Paul &amp; Co., offering no objection so far as they are concerned. From
      the works of Tennyson, Mr Wm. Morris, and a few others, I should have made
      selections, had not the permission been, to my great regret, withheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      d. In the preparation of the Irish group I have been very materially
      assisted by Mr Alfred Percival Graves, who has advised my selection and
      given me the free use of all his own work; and by Mr David J. O'Donoghue,
      author of the <i>Dictionary of the Poets and Poetry of Ireland</i>, who
      has devoted much time to supplying me with information of all kinds, and
      directing me to the work of comparatively unknown authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the use of copyright matter I am also indebted to Mrs Allingham; to
      Professor E. F. Savage-Armstrong, for his own work, and that of his
      brother, the late Edward J. Armstrong; to Lady Ferguson; Miss Emily H.
      Hickey; Mr Michael Hogan; Mr Wm. Winter and Messrs C. Scribner &amp; Sons,
      for a poem by Fitzjames O'Brien; Messrs Routledge &amp; Sons for poems by
      S. Lover; to Mr T. D. Sullivan, M.P.; Mrs K. Tynan (Hinkson); Mr Aubrey de
      Vere and his publishers, Messrs Macmillan &amp; Co.; Mr W. B. Yeats; and
      Dr Sigerson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I have to thank Mr Theodore Watts and Mr Alfred H. Miles, editor
      of <i>The Poets and Poetry of the Century</i>, for information on certain
      questions of copyright.

    <p>
      They craved her favour, but still she said no;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not have gentlemen marry with me,"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet ever they honoured pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now one of them was a gallant young knight,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he came unto her disguised in the night;
    </p>
    <p>
      The second, a gentleman of high degree,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who wooed and sued for prétty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A merchant of London, whose wealth was not small,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was then the third suitor, and proper withal;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her master's own son the fourth man must be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who swore he would die for pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that thou wilt marry with me," quoth the knight,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ill make thee a lady with joy and delight;
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart is enthralled in thy fair beauty,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then grant me thy favour, my pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman said, "Come marry with me,
    </p>
    <p>
      In silks and in velvets my Bessee shall be;
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart lies distracted, oh hear me!" quoth he,
    </p>
    <p>
      "And grant me thy love, my dear pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me be thy husband," the merchant did say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou shalt live in London most gallant and gay;
    </p>
    <p>
      My ships shall bring home rich jewels for thee,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I will for ever love pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bessee she sighed, and thus she did say;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father and mother I mean to obey;
    </p>
    <p>
      First get their goodwill, and be faithful to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      And you shall enjoy your dear pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To every one of them that answer she made;
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore unto her they joyfully said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "This thing to fulfill we all now agree;
    </p>
    <p>
      But where dwells thy father, my pretty Bessee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father," quoth she, "is soon to be seen;
    </p>
    <p>
      The silly blind beggar of Bednall Green,
    </p>
    <p>
      That daily sits begging for charity,
    </p>
    <p>
      He is the kind father of pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "His marks and his token are knowen full well;
    </p>
    <p>
      He always is led by a dog and a bell;
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor silly old man, God knoweth, is he,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he is the true father of pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay," quoth the merchant, "thou art not for me;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She," quoth the innholder, "my wife shall not be;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I loathe," said the gentleman, "a beggar's degree,
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, now farewell, my pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why then," quoth the knight, "hap better or worse,
    </p>
    <p>
      I weigh not true love by the weight of the purse,
    </p>
    <p>
      And beauty is beauty in every degree;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then welcome to me, my dear pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "With thee to thy father forthwith I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, forbear," quoth his kinsman, "it must not be so:
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor beggar's daughter a lady sha'nt be;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then take thy adieu of thy pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon then as it was break of the day,
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight had from Rumford stole Bessee away;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men of Rumford, so sick as may be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Rode after to fetch again pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As swift as the wind to ride they were seen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Until they came near unto Bednall Green,
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the knight lighted most courteously,
    </p>
    <p>
      They fought against him for pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But rescue came presently over the plain,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or else the knight there for his love had been slain;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fray being ended, they straightway did see
    </p>
    <p>
      His kinsman come railing at pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then bespoke the Blind Beggar, "Altho' I be poor,
    </p>
    <p>
      Rail not against my child at my own door;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she be not decked in velvet and pearl,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I will drop angels with thee for my girl;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then if my gold should better her birth,
    </p>
    <p>
      And equal the gold you lay on the earth,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then neither rail you, nor grudge you to see
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blind Beggar's daughter a lady to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "But first, I will hear, and have it well known,
    </p>
    <p>
      The gold that you drop it shall be all you own;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With that," they replied, "contented we be;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then here's," quoth the beggar, "for pretty Bessee."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With that an angel he dropped on the ground,
    </p>
    <p>
      And dropped, in angels, full three thousand pound;
    </p>
    <p>
      And oftentimes it proved most plain,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the gentleman's one, the beggar dropped twain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So that the whole place wherein they did sit
    </p>
    <p>
      With gold was covered every whit;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman having dropt all his store,
    </p>
    <p>
      Said, "Beggar, your hand hold, for I have no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou hast fulfilled thy promise aright;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then marry my girl," quoth he to the knight;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then," quoth he, "I will throw you down,
    </p>
    <p>
      An hundred pound more to buy her a gown."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen all, who his treasure had seen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Admired the Beggar of Bednall Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      And those that had been her suitors before,
    </p>
    <p>
      Their tender flesh for anger they tore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the fair Bessee matched to a knight,
    </p>
    <p>
      And made a lady in others' despite:
    </p>
    <p>
      A fairer lady there never was seen
    </p>
    <p>
      Than the Blind Beggar's daughter of Bednall Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But of her sumptuous marriage and feast,
    </p>
    <p>
      And what fine lords and ladies there prest,
    </p>
    <p>
      The second part shall set forth to your sight,

      daughter so bright,

    <p>
      That late was betrothed to a young knight,
    </p>
    <p>
      All the whole discourse thereof you did see,
    </p>
    <p>
      But now comes the wedding of pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in a gallant palace most brave,
    </p>
    <p>
      Adorned with all the cost they could have,
    </p>
    <p>
      This wedding it was kept most sumptuously,

    <p>
      And all for the love of pretty Bessee.

    </p>
    <p>
      And all kind of dainties and delicates sweet

    <p>
      Was brought to their banquet, as it was thought meet;

    <p>
      Partridge, and plover, and venison most free,
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the brave wedding of pretty Bessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding thro' England was spread by report,
    </p>
    <p>
      So that a great number thereto did resort,
    </p>
    <p>
      Of nobles and gentles of every degree,

    </p>
    <p>
      To church then away went this gallant young knight,
    </p>
    <p>
      His bride followed after, an angel most bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      With troops of ladies, the like was ne'er seen,
    </p>
    <p>
      As went with sweet Bessee of Bednall Green.

      This wedding being solemnized then,
    </p>
    <p>
      With music performed by skilfullest men,
    </p>
    <p>
      The nobles and gentles sat down at that tide,

    <p>
      Each one beholding the beautiful bride.

    </p>

      But after the sumptuous dinner was done,

    <p>
      To talk and to reason a number begun,

    <p>
      And of the Blind Beggar's daughter most bright,

    <p>
      And what with his daughter he gave to the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then spoke the nobles, "Much marvel have we
    </p>
    <p>
      This jolly blind beggar we cannot yet see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lords," quoth the bride, "my father so base

    <p>
      Is loathe with his presence these states to disgrace."

    <p>
      "The praise of a woman in question to bring,

    <p>
      Before her own face, is a flattering thing;

    </p>
    <p>
      They no sooner this pleasant word spoke,
    </p>
    <p>
      But in comes the beggar in a silken cloak,
    </p>
    <p>
      A velvet cap and a feather had he,
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a musician, forsooth, he would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And being led in, from catching of harm,
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a dainty lute under his arm;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said, "Please you to hear any music of me,

    <p>
      A song I will give you of pretty Bessee."

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      With that his lute he twanged straightway,
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereon began most sweetly to play,
    </p>
    <p>
      And after a lesson was played two or three,
    </p>
    <p>
      He strained out this song most delicately:&mdash;

      "Her father he had no goods nor no lands,

    </p>
    <p>
      With a hearty laughter were ready to swound;

    <p>
      At last said the lords, "Full well we may see,

      With crystal water all in her bright eyes;

      "Pardon my father, brave nobles," quoth she,

      Now when the company every one

      Did hear the strange tale he told in his song,

    <p>
      They were amazed, as well as they might be,

    <p>
      Both at the blind beggar and pretty Bessee,

    <p>
      With that the fair bride they all bid embrace,

    <p>
      Saying, "You are come of an honourable race;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy father likewise is of high degree,

    <p>
      A happy bridegroom was made the young knight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who lived in great joy and felicity,

    <p>
      With his fair lady, dear pretty Bessee.

      He caused his body to be taken down

      The parents being dead and gone,

    <p class="indent5">
      The children home he takes,

    <p>
      And brings them straight unto his house,

    <p class="indent5">
      Where much of them he makes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not kept these pretty babes
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      A twelvemonth and a day,
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for their wealth, he did devise
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To make them both away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He bargain'd with two ruffians strong,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Which were of furious mood,
    </p>
    <p>
      That they should take these children young,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And slay them in a wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told his wife an artful tale.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He would the children send
    </p>
    <p>
      To be brought up in fair London,

    <p class="indent5">
      With one that was his friend.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Away then went those pretty babes,

    <p class="indent5">
      Rejoicing at that tide,

      Rejoicing with a merry mind,

    <p class="indent5">
      They should on cock-horse ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      They prate and prattle pleasantly,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As they rode on the way,
    </p>
    <p>
      To those that should their butchers be,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And work their lives decay:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So that the pretty speech they had,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Made Murder's heart relent:
    </p>
    <p>
      And they that undertook the deed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Full sore did now repent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one of them more hard of heart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Did vow to do his charge,
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the wretch, that hired him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Had paid him very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The other won't agree thereto,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      So here they fall to strife;
    </p>
    <p>
      With one another they did fight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      About the children's life:
    </p>
    <p>
      And he that was of mildest mood,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Did slay the other there,
    </p>
    <p>
      Within an unfrequented wood;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The babes did quake for fear!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the children by the hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Tears standing in their eye,
    </p>
    <p>
      And bad them straightway follow him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And look they did not cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      And two long miles he led them on,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While they for food complain:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay here," quoth he, "I'll bring you bread,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When I come back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These pretty babes, with hand in hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Went wandering up and down;
    </p>
    <p>
      But never more could see the man
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Approaching from the town:
    </p>
    <p>
      Their pretty lips with blackberries,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Were all besmear'd and dyed,
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they saw the darksome night,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      They sat them down and cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus wandered these poor innocents,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Till death did end their grief,
    </p>
    <p>
      In one another's arms they died,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As wanting due relief:
    </p>
    <p>
      No burial this pretty pair
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of any man receives,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till Robin-red-breast piously
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Did cover them with leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the heavy wrath of God,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Upon their uncle fell;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,

    <p class="indent5">
      His conscience felt an hell;
    </p>
    <p>
      His barns were fir'd, his goods consum'd,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      His lands were barren made,
    </p>
    <p>
      His cattle died within the field,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And nothing with him stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the voyage of Portugal *
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Two of his sons did die;
